#ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Riccardo Coppola](mailto:riccardo@onefiniteloop.io). I write code

I am a passionate, detail oriented **Team Lead** and **Full Stack JavaScript developer** with over 10 years industry experience, extensive knowledge of DevOps practices and Agile methodologies.

Passionate about testing, workflow automation, code reusability and team dynamics; I focus on writing state of art, highly maintainable web applications using best practices, design patterns and performance testing, following a TDD/BDD approach.

I have hands-on experience in building cross-functional teams on site and in [distributed environments](https://www.onefiniteloop.io/embrace-distributed-teams-and-be-happy/).
Strong believer in the value of productivity as a result of highly efficient workflows, I can happily act as **developer advocate** to help remove obstacles and enable developers to increase velocity.

You can usually find me at the [React London Meetup](https://meetup.react.london/) or the [London Node User Group](https://lnug.org/).

I also blog about development, testing, agile methodologies, psychology of teamwork and other boring topics at [onefiniteloop.io](https://www.onefiniteloop.io/).
