# üëã I'm [Riccardo Coppola](mailto:hi@riccardocoppola.me). I am an engineer

I‚Äôm a staff-level full stack engineer with over 15 years of industry experience, currently focused on building scalable systems, improving developer experience, and fostering high-trust engineering cultures.

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked across e-commerce, travel, government, and fashion ‚Äî leading cross-functional teams in both co-located and [distributed environments](https://www.riccardocoppola.me/embrace-distributed-teams-and-be-happy/). I care deeply about the craft of software engineering: clean code, thoughtful architecture, and workflows that make developers faster and happier.

My core stack is JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js, but I‚Äôve worked across many technologies and have strong DevOps and infrastructure experience (Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD systems). I‚Äôm passionate about testing, automation, and making quality the default. I‚Äôve built design systems from scratch, automated release pipelines, introduced visual regression testing across frontends, and helped teams ship faster with fewer bugs.

I‚Äôm especially motivated by what sits between disciplines: the handoff from design to dev, the intersection of frontend and backend, the glue work that improves how teams function day to day. I enjoy mentoring engineers, digging deep into complex debugging challenges, and helping build calm, high-performing teams that value focus, autonomy, and shared excellence.

**I ‚ù§Ô∏è what I do** ‚Äî and I bring that same care and intention to every product, platform, and team I work with.
