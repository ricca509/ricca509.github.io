# ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Riccardo](mailto:hi@riccardocoppola.me). I am an engineer.

Iâ€™m a staff-level full stack engineer with 15+ years of experience, focused on building scalable systems, improving developer experience, and fostering high-trust engineering cultures.

Iâ€™ve worked across e-commerce, travel, government, and fashion â€” leading cross-functional teams in both co-located and distributed environments. I care deeply about clean code, thoughtful architecture, and workflows that make shipping software smoother and more sustainable.

My core stack is JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js, alongside strong infrastructure experience with Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD systems. Iâ€™m passionate about testing, automation, and building quality into the foundation. Iâ€™ve delivered design systems, visual regression testing, and live-update pipelines that have helped teams ship faster with fewer bugs.

Iâ€™m especially motivated by what sits between disciplines: design to dev, frontend to backend, the glue work that quietly improves team velocity and product quality. I enjoy mentoring, deep debugging, and helping build calm, focused, high-performing teams.

I love what I do â€” and I bring that same care and intention to every product, platform, and team I join.
