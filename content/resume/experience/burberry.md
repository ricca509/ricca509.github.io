I joined to help shape the new micro front end architecture, part of the wider re-platforming of Burberry’s ecom. During my contract I led two of our distributed teams of developers, located in Minsk and Shanghai, while working with stakeholders and designers in-house. Day to day activities with the team included working on stories, mentoring other team members, reviewing merge requests, working with the BA to review stories and prepare sprint goals and working with the designers to make sure all the edge cases were included.

Particular focus was also put on working with all teams overseas to agree on high level solutions and create a consistent workflow that all our teams could follow. Consistency and simplicity were key, to ensure that the cognitive load was kept to a minimum and the code produced would follow our standards regardless of where it was produced.

As part of my assignment, I also worked closely with the design team to help build the company’s design system: from defining the key strategy and technologies to use to building a set of design tokens to be used across web, email and native apps.
