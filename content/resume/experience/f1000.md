Responsible for the development and maintenance of our web applications: working closely with our team of business analysts, designers, backend developers and QAs in an Agile team. My job involved writing JavaScript libraries to be used across the apps, turning PSD designs into semantic HTML5 applications; adding complex interactions handled with the best JavaScript tools and frameworks, always creating modular and maintainable code even with tight schedules.

I improved the front end workflow by introducing an automated flow for the development: with Grunt.js, we now automate the whole process. From a morning job that takes care of updating the local repository, builds and the deploys the app; to a watcher that lints, checks the coding style with jscs, tests and concatenates + minify and deploy at every file save. I automated the documentation process creating a live styleguide with KSS.

In our Agile environment we used Jira to handle our sprints' workflow and Jenkins to build, deploy and test our code.
