I worked with KLM for the Unavolta project. Unavolta.net is a web application (both desktop and mobile versions available) designed to let people upload their travel photos (with a poetic message) in order to participate in a contest and win a flight. Additionally, every week (for eight weeks) a new video is published to inspire travellers. My responsibility for the project was to design and develop the mobile interface.
