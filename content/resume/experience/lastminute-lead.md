As Team Lead my goal was to give our UI teams a long term vision. Apart from developing (I spent at least 70% of my time developing with the team) I then invested more time on new technologies, best practices and patterns to use across our teams and improved ways of managing our workflows.

Part of the improvements put in place include:

- strict use of Git merge requests/code reviews (with auto merge request builder)
- a fully automated cloud CI for all our four environments a "dockerized" version of our apps to make it easy to test and deploy everywhere
- monthly meeting with back-end devs, tech ops and architect to give all developers a big picture of our projects.
- hosting a Js meetup (http://www.meetup.com/js-monthly-london/) in our London office

I led UI teams in our London and Madrid offices and was also involved in various social activities to bring developers together: brown bag sessions, meetups, team conference calls.
