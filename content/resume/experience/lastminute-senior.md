I worked on the [m.lastminute.com](https://m.lastminute.com) mobile application, supported junior developers and spread the knowledge across the teams with tech meetings about good practices and new technologies to introduce in our workflow.

We worked in a Kanban environment, following a TDD/BDD approach in teams with PO, BAs, marketing people, QAs, UI designers, back end developers and front end developers. My focus was on the Backbone Mobile SPA application.
