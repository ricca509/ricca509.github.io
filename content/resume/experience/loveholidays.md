I joined as senior developer to help on the booking flow application: this is a high traffic, high performance application that is deployed multiple times a day and fully tested (including performance with Lighthouse) on every deployment.

In addition to working on new features and helping more junior developers, I worked as developer advocate to progress key initiatives across teams. These include: a new design system able to pull data directly from Figma, a visual regression test tool based on Backstop.js that is currently part of all our frontend applications. These improvements helped massively with developer confidence and produced more production deployments as a final result.

I am currently working on rebuilding the "Manage my bookings" application from scratch, for web and native apps.
