During my career at Prometeo I had the chance to work on a wide range of projects:
from building a complete server rack to implementing a site crawler using the Selenium API to designing and developing web applications using multiple different technologies.
My responsibilities included: gathering user requirements, choosing the right technologies to use, implementing server and client side code, testing and production deployment. I was involved in the R&D area too: building and testing new technologies for upcoming projects.
