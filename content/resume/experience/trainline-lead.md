As Team Lead I focussed on Trainline's re-platforming (going from monolithic .NET backend and React FE to .NET microservices and Node/React micro-frontends). As part of the role, I helped creating a new team, made the required hirings and worked more with POs/BAs. I kept my position strongly technical (at least 70% coding).

My impact area widened, focusing on giving the team the stability and continuity needed to deliver high-quality software respecting the company's deadlines. Given the small size of the squad, this was achieved by wearing different hats at different times, to ensure that all the required functions were present when needed: helping with BA functions, technical recruiting and DevOps work, driving innovation to support the product (“3G days”, “No Chrome days”), mentorship and internal growth and working cross-team to exchange knowledge and drive the development forward.
