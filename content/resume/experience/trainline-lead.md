I was promoted to Team Lead to focus on our re-platforming (going from monolithic .NET backend and React FE to .NET microservices and Node/React micro-frontends). As part of the role I helped creating a new team, made the required hiring and worked more with POs/BAs. I kept my position strongly technical (at least 70% coding).

My impact area widened, focusing on giving the team the stability and continuity that it needed to deliver high quality software respecting the company's deadlines. Given the small size of the squad, this was achieved by wearing different hats at different times, to ensure that all the required functions were present when needed:

- Helping with BA functions: our lead BA has been shared with other squads for
  most of the time and I've helped in making sure every sprint had a clear
  direction and refined stories.
- Helping with recruiting: making sure we have the right people, especially in such a small squad, is crucial, this is why I have spent a lot of time finding a new hiring process to suit our needs.
- Helping with devOps work: I have constantly driven the work on the devops
  side, making sure that our pipeline and automated processes run smoothly
  and give the developers the confidence they need as quickly as possible. For instance, our E2E tests are now running in parallel saving 50% of time each build, and the total build time has gone from 19' to about 7-8'. These means quicker feedbacks, more PRs closed during the day and ultimately a higher velocity
- Driving innovation to support the product: the only way to really improve
  software is to first use it in anger. For this reason we organized “3G days” and “No Chrome days”, to push developers and QAs to confront with real world scenarios: this has already driven improvements across different browsers
- Mentorship and internal growth: I spent time bringing people up to
  speed as quickly as possible but also on helping our permanent team to grow their skills.
- Working cross-team to exchange knowledge and drive the development: our
  re-platforming has seen the rise of micro services and with them, a new set of communication challenges. As a webapp, our team consumes many of
  these services and the biggest challenge has been to bring everything
  together. This has been achieved by sometimes sharing developers across
  squads and through a lot of cross-team communication.
