I joined to help shape a better agile process, help junior developers to step up and ensure a more predictable, high-quality development process.

In pursuing the above, we stabilized the agile process by streamlining the ceremonies, hired more junior members and turned them into mid-level engineer, introduced cross-device integration tests and removed all manual QA-ing, introduced bug hunts/manual discoveries, improved the code reviewing process, allowing the developers more time to review, discuss and deliver better code.

I also worked across our projects with micro/macro refactorings to increase code quality and encourage reusability and helped the HR hiring team to create a better tech hiring process.
