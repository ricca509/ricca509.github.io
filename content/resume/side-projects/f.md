A small library to be used in all those multiple pages (server side MVC) projects that usually don’t have a structured js due to the fact that most of the job is done on the server.

It is _“A small, modular library that helps writing structured, reusable, testable and namespaced JavaScript code. It also provides DOM helpers and a pub/sub implementation”_. Published in the Bower repository.
