My personal website: a web application built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), using [Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-transformer-remark) files as data source for the content.

Open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/ricca509/ricca509.github.io), hosted on GitHub pages and deployed automatically at every change using GitHub actions. DNS and routing handled through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
