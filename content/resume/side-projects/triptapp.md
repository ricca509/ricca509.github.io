Co-founder of triptapp: we developed the web application and designed the mobile application. The webapp development involved social authentication, a NoSQL database (mongoDB), an API to interface with Google Maps, a client side app to handle data about places positions, like, etc and a REST API to handle AJAX calls. The mobile app used a REST API in Node.js as backend and HTML5 with Backbone.js (accessing the deviceâ€™s features through Cordova/PhoneGap).

Built using HTML5/CSS3, LESS, Backbone.js, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, Yii Framework (PHP), mongoDB. Integrated with Google Maps, Hosted on Windows Azure (Linux VM).
