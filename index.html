Strong believer in the value of productivity as a result of highly efficient workflows, I can happily act as developer advocate to help break down obstacles and enable developers to increase velocity.</p><p>I love challenging and creative environments where I can support the growth of other developers, improve the projects I work on and craft code that others love to read and maintain.</p><p>I regularly attend meetups in the London tech scene such as London Web, London React User Group and London Node User Group.</p><p>Increasingly interested in blockchain technologies and their applications to solve real world scenarios and improve people lives.</p><p>I ♥ what I do.</p></div><h2>Experience</h2><h3>Burberry</h3><p><strong>Lead Developer (Consultant)</strong></p><p><em>Jan 2019 - Present [London, United Kingdom]</em></p><div><p>I was hired to help shape the new micro front end architecture, part of the wider re-platforming of Burberry’s ecom. During my contract I led two of our distributed teams of developers, located in Minsk and Shanghai, while working with stakeholders and designers in-house. Day to day activities with the team included working on stories, mentoring other team members, reviewing merge requests, working with the BA to review stories and prepare sprint goals and working with the designers to make sure all the edge cases were included.</p><p>  Particular focus was also put on working with all teams overseas to agree on high level solutions and create a consistent workflow that all our teams could follow. Consistency and simplicity were key, to ensure that the cognitive load was kept to a minimun and the code produced would follow our standards regardless of where it was produced.</p><p>  As part of my assignment, I also worked closely with the design team to help build the company’s design system: from defining the key strategy and technologies to use to building a set of design tokens to be used across web, email and native apps.</p></div><div><strong>Key Technologies used:</strong><p>React, Redux, redux-saga, Next.js, Gatsby, SASS, Styled components, Backpack, style-dictionary, Cypress, GitLab, GitLab CI, AWS</p></div><h3>Trainline</h3><p><strong>Development Team Lead</strong></p><p><em>Nov 2016 - Dec 2018 [London, United Kingdom]</em></p><div><p>I was promoted to Team Lead to focus on our complete re-platforming (going from monolithic .NET backend and React FE to .NET microservices and Node/React micro-frontends). As part of the role I created a new team, made the required hiring and worked more with POs/BAs. I’ve kept my position strongly technical (at least 70% coding) as I believe the team lead should be part of the sprint as everyone else.</p><p>My impact area widened, focusing on giving the team the stability and continuity that it needed to deliver high quality software respecting the company&#x27;s deadline. Given the small size of the squad, this has been achieved by wearing different hats at different times, to ensure that all the required functions were present when needed:</p><ul><li>Helping with BA functions: our lead BA has been shared with other squads for
most of the time and I&#x27;ve helped in making sure every sprint had a clear
direction and refined stories.</li><li>Helping with recruiting: making sure we have the right people, especially in such a small squad, is crucial, this is why I have spent a lot of time finding a new hiring process to suit our needs.</li><li>Helping with devOps work: I have constantly driven the work on the devops
side, making sure that our pipeline and automated processes run smoothly
and give the developers the confidence they need as quickly as possible. For instance, our E2E tests are now running in parallel saving 50% of time each build, and the total build time has gone from 19&#x27; to about 7-8&#x27;. These means quicker feedbacks, more PRs closed during the day and ultimately a higher velocity</li><li>Driving innovation to support the product: the only way to really improve
software is to first use it in anger. For this reason we organized “3G days” and “No Chrome days”, to push developers and QAs to confront with real world scenarios: this has already driven improvements across different browsers</li><li>Mentorship and internal growth: I spent time bringing people up to
speed as quickly as possible but also on helping our permanent team to grow their skills.</li><li>Working cross-team to exchange knowledge and drive the development: our
re-platforming has seen the rise of micro services and with them, a new set of communication challenges. As a webapp, our team consumes many of
these services and the biggest challenge has been to bring everything
together. This has been achieved by sometimes sharing developers across
squads and through a lot of cross-team communication.</li></ul></div><h3>Trainline</h3><p><strong>Senior JavaScript Developer</strong></p><p><em>Oct 2015 - Oct 2016 [London, United Kingdom]</em></p><div><p>As a senior developer, I joined the team to help shape a better agile process, help more junior developers to step up and ensure a more predictable, high quality development process. In pursuing the above, we:</p><ul><li>Stabilized the agile process by streamlining the ceremonies: the morning standup (quick and efficient), having more focused grooming and planning sessions (quick meetings make devs happy), and having a more productive retrospective. We removed all meetings that were unnecessary/long/without a clear intent</li><li>Hired more junior members and turned them into mid-level engineer, fighting the increasingly difficult situation of hiring permanents</li><li>Introduced cross-devices integration tests and removed all manual qa-ing, with the aim of increasing the team confidence and speeding up the release process</li><li>Introduced bug hunts/manual discoveries, when the team would randomly test (almost monkey test) the app and come up with scenarios to be covered by integration tests</li><li>Introduced a stricter code reviewing process, allowing the developers more time to review, discuss and deliver better code</li><li>Worked across our projects with micro/macro refactorings to increase code quality and encourage reusability</li><li>Worked alongside the HR hiring team to create a better hiring process (tech tests/on site interviews and whiteboard tests) that would fit our increased need in high quality developers</li></ul><p>This resulted in a happier team and more frequent/better releases.</p></div><div><strong>Key Technologies used:</strong><p>React, Redux, CSS-in-JS, redux-observable, Cypress, Node.js, Express, Helmet, GitHub, Teamcity, AWS</p></div><h3>lastminute.com</h3><p><strong>UI Tech Lead</strong></p><p><em>Jan 2015 - Oct 2015 [London, United Kingdom]</em></p><div><p>I was promoted to Tech Lead to give our UI teams a long term vision. Apart from developing (I still spend at least 70% of my time developing with the team) I then invested more time on new technologies, best practices and patterns to use across our teams and improved ways of managing our workflows.</p><p>Part of the improvements put in place include:</p><ul><li>strict use of Git merge requests/code reviews (with auto merge request builder)</li><li>a fully automated cloud CI for all our four environments a &quot;dockerized&quot; version of our apps to make it easy to test and deploy everywhere</li><li>monthly meeting with back-end devs, tech ops and architect to give all developers a big picture of our projects.</li><li>hosting a Js meetup (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/js-monthly-london/">http://www.meetup.com/js-monthly-london/</a>) in our London office</li></ul><p>I led UI teams in our London and Madrid offices and was also involved in various social activities to bring developers together: brown bag sessions, meetups, team conference calls.</p></div><h3>lastminute.com</h3><p><strong>Senior UI developer</strong></p><p><em>Apr 2014 - Dec 2014 [London, United Kingdom]</em></p><p>As a senior UI developer, I worked on the <a href="https://m.lastminute.com">m.lastminute.com</a> mobile application, supported junior developers and spread the knowledge across the teams with tech meetings about good practices and new technologies to introduce in our workflow.
  We worked in a Kanban environment, following a TDD/BDD approach in teams with PO, BAs, marketing people, QAs, UI designers, back end developers and front end developers.

My job involved writing JavaScript libraries to be used across the apps, turning PSD designs into semantic HTML5 applications; adding complex interactions handled with the best JavaScript tools and frameworks, always creating modular and maintainable code even with tight schedules.</p><p>I improved the front end workflow by introducing an automated flow for the development: with Grunt.js, we now automate the whole process. From a morning job that takes care of updating the local repository, builds and the deploys the app; to a watcher that lints, checks the coding style with jscs, tests and concatenates + minify and deploy at every file save. I automated the documentation process creating a live styleguide with KSS.</p><p>In our Agile environment we used Jira to handle our sprints&#x27; workflow and Jenkins to build, deploy and test our code.</p></div><div><strong>Key Technologies used:</strong><p>HTML5 semantic markup, CSS3 and SASS with Compass, jQuery, Underscore and Backbone, Grunt.js</p></div><h3>KLM</h3><p><strong>Senior Mobile Front End Developer</strong></p><p><em>2013 [Italy]</em></p><p>I worked with KLM for the Unavolta project.
