## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

[hello@ricca509.me](hello@ricca509.me)

[github.com/ricca509](https://github.com/ricca509)

I am a passionate, detail oriented Full Stack JavaScript developer who can easily and happily wear the DevOps hat.

I have strong experience writing state of art web applications using best practices, design patterns and performance testing, strictly following a TDD/BDD approach.

Team player, I have extensive, hands-on experience with Agile methodologies (Kanban/Scrum/XP/pair programming), building cross-functional teams on site and in distributed environments ([onefiniteloop.io/embrace-distributed-teams-and-be-happy](https://www.onefiniteloop.io/embrace-distributed-teams-and-be-happy/)).

I love challenging and creative environments where I can support the growth of other developers, improve the projects I work on and craft code that others love to read and maintain.

I regularly attend meetups in the London tech scene such as London Web, London React User Group and London Node User Group.

Increasingly interested in blockchain technologies and their applications to solve real orld scenarios and improve people lives.

I ♥ what I do.

## Experience

### Burberry

**Lead Developer** (Consultant)

_Jan 2019 - Present [London, United Kingdom]_

### Trainline

**Development Team Lead**

_Nov 2016 - Dec 2018 [London, United Kingdom]_

I was promoted to Team Lead to focus on our complete re-platforming (going from monolithic .NET backend and React FE to .NET microservices and Node/React micro-frontends). As part of the role I created a new team, made the required hiring and worked more with POs/BAs. I’ve kept my position strongly technical (at least 70% coding) as I believe the team lead should be part of the sprint as everyone else.

My impact area widened, focusing on giving the team the stability and continuity that it needed to deliver high quality software respecting the company's deadline. Given the small size of the squad, this has been achieved by wearing different hats at different times, to ensure that all the required functions were present when needed:

- Helping with BA functions: our lead BA has been shared with other squads for
  most of the time and I've helped in making sure every sprint had a clear
  direction and refined stories.
- Helping with recruiting: making sure we have the right people, especially in such a small squad, is crucial, this is why I have spent a lot of time finding a new hiring process to suit our needs.
- Helping with devOps work: I have constantly driven the work on the devops
  side, making sure that our pipeline and automated processes run smoothly
  and give the developers the confidence they need as quickly as possible. For instance, our E2E tests are now running in parallel saving 50% of time each build, and the total build time has gone from 19' to about 7-8'. These means quicker feedbacks, more PRs closed during the day and ultimately a higher velocity
- Driving innovation to support the product: the only way to really improve
  software is to first use it in anger. For this reason we organized “3G days” and “No Chrome days”, to push developers and QAs to confront with real world scenarios: this has already driven improvements across different browsers
- Mentorship and internal growth: I spent time bringing people up to
  speed as quickly as possible but also on helping our permanent team to grow their skills.
- Working cross-team to exchange knowledge and drive the development: our
  re-platforming has seen the rise of micro services and with them, a new set of communication challenges. As a webapp, our team consumes many of
  these services and the biggest challenge has been to bring everything
  together. This has been achieved by sometimes sharing developers across
  squads and through a lot of cross-team communication.

**Senior JavaScript Developer**

_Oct 2015 - Oct 2016 [London, United Kingdom]_

As a senior developer, I joined the team to help shape a better agile process, help more junior developers to step up and ensure a more predictable, high quality development process. In pursuing the above, we:

- Stabilized the agile process by streamlining the ceremonies: the morning standup (quick and efficient), having more focused grooming and planning sessions (quick meetings make devs happy), and having a more productive retrospective. We removed all meetings that were unnecessary/long/without a clear intent
- Hired more junior members and turned them into mid-level engineer, fighting the increasingly difficult situation of hiring permanents
- Introduced cross-devices integration tests and removed all manual qa-ing, with the aim of increasing the team confidence and speeding up the release process
- Introduced bug hunts/manual discoveries, when the team would randomly test (almost monkey test) the app and come up with scenarios to be covered by integration tests
- Introduced a stricter code reviewing process, allowing the developers more time to review, discuss and deliver better code
- Worked across our projects with micro/macro refactorings to increase code quality and encourage reusability
- Worked alongside the HR hiring team to create a better hiring process (tech tests/on site interviews and whiteboard tests) that would fit our increased need in high quality developers

This resulted in a happier team and more frequent/better releases.

**UI Tech Lead**

_Jan 2015 - Oct 2015 [London, United Kingdom]_

I was promoted to Tech Lead to give our UI teams a long term vision. Apart from developing (I still spend at least 70% of my time developing with the
team) I am now investing more time on new technologies, best practices and patterns to use across our teams and improved ways of managing our workflows.
Part of the improvements already in place include:

- strict use of Git merge requests/code reviews (with auto merge request builder)
- a fully automated cloud CI for all our four environments a "dockerized" version of our apps to make it easy to test and deploy everywhere
- monthly meeting with back-end devs, tech ops and architect to give all developers a big picture of our projects.
- hosting a Js meetup (http://www.meetup.com/js-monthly-london/) in our London office

At the moment, I am leading UI teams in our London and Madrid offices. I am also involved in many social activities to bring developers together: I believe that good friends always make great teams.

**Senior UI developer**

_Apr 2014 - Dec 2014 [London, United Kingdom]_

As a senior UI developer, I craft the new m.lastminute.com mobile application, support junior developers and spread the knowledge across the teams with tech meetings about good practices and new technologies to introduce in our workflow.
We work in a Kanban environment, following a TDD/BDD approach in teams with PO, BAs, marketing people, QAs, UI designers, back end developers and front end developers. My focus is on the Backbone Mobile SPA application.

**Key Technologies used:**

Marionette/Backbone/underscore, React.js, jQuery/Zepto, RequireJS and
Browserify, Jasmine/Cucumber.js/WebDriverJS, SASS/Compass, Git, Jenkins.

### Faculty of 1000

**Senior Front End Developer**

_Sept 2013 - Apr 2014 [London, United Kingdom]_

Responsible for the development and maintenance of our web applications: working closely with our team of business analysts, designers, backend developers and QAs in an Agile team, we aim to deliver perfect products at every iteration. My job involved writing JavaScript libraries to be used across the apps, turning PSD designs into well crafted, semantic HTML5 applications; adding complex interactions handled with the best JavaScript tools and frameworks, always creating modular and maintainable code even with tight schedules.

I improved the front end workflow by introducing an automated flow for the development: with Grunt.js, we now automate the whole process. From a morning job that takes care of updating the local repository, builds and the deploys the app; to a watcher that lints, checks the coding style with jscs (I am still fine tuning it to find the best style), tests and concatenates + minify and deploy at every ctrl+s. I automated the documentation process creating a live styleguide with KSS. 

With these improvements, we are cutting down times and avoid bugs.
In our Agile environment we use Jira to handle our sprints' workflow and Jenkins to build, deploy and test our code.

**Key Technologies used:**
HTML5 semantic markup, CSS3 and SASS with Compass, jQuery, Underscore and Backbone, Grunt.js to automate all the front end flow
