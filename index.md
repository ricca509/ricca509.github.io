## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

I’m a passionate, detail oriented Full Stack JavaScript developer who can easily and happily wear the DevOps hat.

I have strong experience writing state of art web applications using best
practices, design patterns and performance testing, strictly following a TDD/BDD approach.

Team player, I have extensive, hands-on experience with Agile methodologies
(Kanban/Scrum/XP/pair programming).

I love challenging and creative environments where I can constantly share and learn, improve
the projects I work on and craft code that others love to read and maintain.

I regularly attend meetups in the London tech scene such as London Web, London React
User Group and London Node User Group.

Increasingly interested in blockchain technologies and their applications to solve real world scenarios and improve people lives.

I ♥ what I do.
