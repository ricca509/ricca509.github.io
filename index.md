## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpeg">

I’m a passionate, detail oriented Full Stack JavaScript developer who can easily and happily wear the DevOps hat.

I have strong experience writing state of art web applications using best
practices, design patterns and performance testing, strictly following a TDD/BDD approach.

Team player, I have extensive, hands-on experience with Agile methodologies
(Kanban/Scrum/XP/pair programming).

I love challenging and creative environments where I can constantly share and learn, improve
the projects I work on and craft code that others love to read and maintain.

I regularly attend meetups in the London tech scene such as London Web, London React
User Group and London Node User Group.

Increasingly interested in blockchain technologies and their applications to solve real world scenarios and improve people lives.

I ♥ what I do.

## Experience

### Burberry

**Lead Technical Consultant**

_Jan 2019 - Present in London, United Kingdom_

### Trainline

**Development Team Lead**

_Nov 2016 - Dec 2018 in London, United Kingdom_

I was been promoted to Team Lead to focus on our complete re-platforming (going
from monolithic .NET backend and React FE to .NET microservices and Node/React
webapps). As part of the role I created a new team, made the required hiring and worked more with POs/BAs. I’ve kept my position strongly technical (at least 70% coding) as I believe the team lead should be part of the sprint as everyone else. My impact area widened, focusing on giving the team the stability and continuity that it needed to deliver high quality software respecting the company's deadline. Given the small size of the squad, this has been achieved by wearing different hats at different times, to ensure that all the required functions were present when needed:

- Helping with BA functions: our lead BA has been shared with other squads for
  most of the time and I've helped in making sure every sprint had a clear
  direction and refined stories.
- Helping with recruiting: making sure we have the right people, especially in
  such a small squad, is crucial, this is why I have spent a lot of time finding a
  new hiring process to suit our needs.
- Helping with devOps work: I have constantly driven the work on the devops
  side, making sure that our pipeline and automated processes run smoothly
  and give the developers the confidence they need as quickly as possible. For
  instance, our E2E tests are now running in parallel saving 50% of time each
  build, and the total build time has gone from 19' to about 7-8'. These means
  quicker feedbacks, more PRs closed during the day and ultimately a higher
  velocity
- Driving innovation to support the product: the only way to really improve
  software is to first use it in anger. For this reason I've organized “3G days”
  and “No Chrome days”, to push developers and QAs to confront with real
  world scenarios: this has already driven improvements across different
  browsers
- Mentorship and internal growth: I have spent time bringing people up to
  speed as quickly as possible but also on helping our permanent team to grow
  their skills.
- Working cross-team to exchange knowledge and drive the development: our
  re-platforming has seen the rise of micro services and with them, a new set
  of communication challenges. As a webapp, our team consumes many of
  these services and the biggest challenge has been to bring everything
  together. This has been achieved by sometimes sharing developers across
  squads and through a lot of cross-team communication.

**Senior JavaScript Developer**

_Oct 2015 - Oct 2016 in London, United Kingdom_

As a senior developer, I joined the team to help shape a better agile process, help more junior developers to step up and ensure a more predictable, high quality development process. In pursuing the above, we:

- stabilized the agile process by streamlining the ceremonies: the morning standup (quick and efficient), having more focused grooming and planning sessions (quick meetings make devs happy), and having a more productive retrospective. We removed all meetings that were unnecessary/long/without a clear intent
- hired more junior members and turned them into mid-level engineer, fighting the increasingly difficult situation of hiring permanents
- introduced cross-devices integration tests and removed all manual qa-ing, with the aim of increasing the team confidence and speeding up the release process
- introduced bug hunts/manual discoveries, when the team would randomly test (almost monkey test) the app and come up with scenarios to be covered by integration tests
- introduced a stricter code reviewing process, allowing the developers more time to review, discuss and deliver better code
- worked across our projects with micro/macro refactorings to increase code quality and encourage reusability
- worked alongside the HR hiring team to create a better hiring process (tech tests/on site interviews and whiteboard tests) that would fit our increased need in high quality developers

All this resulted in a happier team and more frequent/better releases.
