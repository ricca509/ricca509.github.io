Then act</h2>\n<p>Communication in a co-located team happens as a result of people sharing the same room at the same time: a side effect of sitting together is feeling more comfortable in sharing ideas and raising issues.</p>\n<p>Working from the same office means ignoring a whole set of issues around distributed communications that can bring productivity to a halt when working with people in different locations.</p>\n<p>The key point in this scenario is to make everyone feel empowered to report problems that would otherwise affect everyone. One way of doing it is to show how serious we are in tackling those issues: <strong>listen carefully, then act effectively</strong>. Showing care builds trust.</p>\n<p>If the microphone is not working during a meeting and it is being reported by the people on the call, stop and fix it, change it, or change room. Do not resume the discussion until the problem is fixed: losing input from a whole part of the team is much worse than stopping the meeting for a few minutes (or even moving it to a different time).</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-your-communication-tools-wisely\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#choose-your-communication-tools-wisely\" aria-label=\"choose your communication tools wisely permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg height=\"20\" width=\"20\" viewBox=\"-32 0 512 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M440.667 182.109l7.143-40c1.313-7.355-4.342-14.109-11.813-14.109h-74.81l14.623-81.891C377.123 38.754 371.468 32 363.997 32h-40.632a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891L296.175 128H197.54l14.623-81.891C213.477 38.754 207.822 32 200.35 32h-40.632a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891L132.528 128H53.432a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891l-7.143 40C33.163 185.246 38.818 192 46.289 192h74.81L98.242 320H19.146a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891l-7.143 40C-1.123 377.246 4.532 384 12.003 384h74.81L72.19 465.891C70.877 473.246 76.532 480 84.003 480h40.632a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891L151.826 384h98.634l-14.623 81.891C234.523 473.246 240.178 480 247.65 480h40.632a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891L315.472 384h79.096a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891l7.143-40c1.313-7.355-4.342-14.109-11.813-14.109h-74.81l22.857-128h79.096a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891zM261.889 320h-98.634l22.857-128h98.634l-22.857 128z\"/></svg></a>Choose your communication tools wisely</h2>\n<p>The first step in setting up to work within a distributed environment is to have the right tools in place.</p>\n<p>It is vital to make it easy for people to communicate: you don’t want to add any additional barrier to those already created by the distance.</p>\n<p>Whether people sit in the same office or not, <strong>you need a tool to organise and track the work</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\">Jira</a> and <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a> are the most widely used solutions nowadays, pick the one you and your team like the most, no big deals here.

Also related to setting up your rooms, having a <strong>conference speakerphone</strong> can really make a difference when many people are sat around a table and far from the laptop: <a href=\"https://www.jabra.co.uk/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series/jabra-speak-410#/#100-43000000-40\">Jabra Speak 410</a> proved to be effective for this in my experience.

In such an environment, blockers can be passed to a fresh pair of eyes at the end of the day and possibly get resolved by next morning, something that would be impossible when following the same working hours.</p>\n<p>Of course it all comes at a cost, and teams situated in different time zones require more preparation.</p>\n<p>To remove all possible issues and blockers, make sure you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>spend time during your day (and before their day start) to organise work and detail everything to limit the unknowns and make every team a self-sufficient unit</li>\n<li>review code or designs as soon as possible</li>\n<li>leave actionable feedbacks in the comments</li>\n<li>ensure they can be as independent as possible during their day and always plan more work in advance so if anything comes up they can progress to another task without getting blocked</li>\n<li>find the golden time when everyone is online and move stand up to that time. If the time difference is really relevant, you may only have a small window of time: use it to make everyone meet and have at least standup all together</li>\n<li>structure your teams as if the whole team was remote: there are not first-class citizens working in a central location, everyone is a remote worker</li>\n<li>Alternate time zones: if you need to have meetings at inconvenient times, make sure you make it “inconvenient” for a different team each month</li>\n<li>have people from different teams having informal 1:1 once a week: this helps building relationships and trust, making it easier in the future for everyone to communicate issues and blockers without fear. Make a rule to not cancel them because of a “more” important meeting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"respect-and-embrace-cultural-differences\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#respect-and-embrace-cultural-differences\" aria-label=\"respect and embrace cultural differences permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg height=\"20\" width=\"20\" viewBox=\"-32 0 512 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M440.667 182.109l7.143-40c1.313-7.355-4.342-14.109-11.813-14.109h-74.81l14.623-81.891C377.123 38.754 371.468 32 363.997 32h-40.632a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891L296.175 128H197.54l14.623-81.891C213.477 38.754 207.822 32 200.35 32h-40.632a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891L132.528 128H53.432a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891l-7.143 40C33.163 185.246 38.818 192 46.289 192h74.81L98.242 320H19.146a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891l-7.143 40C-1.123 377.246 4.532 384 12.003 384h74.81L72.19 465.891C70.877 473.246 76.532 480 84.003 480h40.632a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891L151.826 384h98.634l-14.623 81.891C234.523 473.246 240.178 480 247.65 480h40.632a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891L315.472 384h79.096a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891l7.143-40c1.313-7.355-4.342-14.109-11.813-14.109h-74.81l22.857-128h79.096a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891zM261.889 320h-98.634l22.857-128h98.634l-22.857 128z\"/></svg></a>Respect and embrace cultural differences</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Globally distributed teams will be effective vehicles for knowledge sharing in an organisation as long as individuals learn the cultural logic of others’ divergent beliefs. If not, culture is constructed as something which divides individuals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e3b9/57e8c1f6a286ce3b8876c12701a073a8f0c5.pdf\">Multinational and Multicultural Distributed Teams: A Review and Future Agenda</a></em></p>\n<p>When working with people living in other parts of the world, there is so much more than a cold colleague-to-colleague relationship to be experienced: I am always impressed by the differences in the way of working and living that I get to experience whenever I work with a new team.</p>\n<p>I always make it a priority to get to know and experience their culture as much as possible: be it food, architecture, history. Every country has something peculiar that can spark my interest and that enriches not only me as a person but gives me a common ground to create a better environment at work. Just by looking at specific traits of a country can reveal so much about the people I am working with and, needless to say, helps a lot with the daily work relationships.</p>\n<p>Knowing people personalities, habits and needs will help you with the daily organisation of work in a way that can improve productivity and boost team morale: people that see their culture respected will inevitably be happier when working with you. This may mean adjusting your communication patterns to use/avoid words or phrases that may be offensive, moving meetings to avoid specific parts of their day.</p>\n<p><figure

together as often as possible, not only to talk about work, but (mainly) to have fun and get to know each other: common experiences are the building block of trust and the return you get from it far

paragraph.</em></p>\n<p>Think about all the micro-interactions you have on a day-to-day basis that make where you work an enjoyable place to spend the best part of your day: how do you replicate these when working with distributed teams?</p>\n<p>The first, obvious answer is to try and spend time together, in person, but this is seldom achievable for companies with multiple teams.</p>\n<p>Another way, that can work every day and build lasting rapports is to use your communication tool (Slack, Teams, whatever) and create a safe place that everyone can access: create a “Fun” channel and let people create sub-channels with things that interest them. It could be a book club, where every week people from around the globe share the book they’re reading, review previous ones and give suggestions to other people. It could be a photography channel where photos are shared and commented, the latest gears discussed, tips are given.
