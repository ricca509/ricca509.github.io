What we make of it is entirely up to us.</p>\n<p>We live in a fast-moving world, and we grow up learning to categorise things as either good or bad. It’s useful: it helps us navigate life quickly and make much-needed decisions based on recognisable patterns.</p>\n<p>Imagine if we had to evaluate things from scratch every time something similar happened — we’d never know what to do.</p>\n<p>A salary increase — good. A punctured tyre — bad.</p>\n<p>Pattern recognition is a useful skill — and a largely beneficial one. But it can also stop us from seeing past the surface of the events in our lives.</p>\n<p>I like to revisit the following chinese parable from time to time — a reminder that things are never inherently good or bad.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maybe-so-maybe-not\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#maybe-so-maybe-not\" aria-label=\"maybe so maybe not permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg height=\"20\" width=\"20\" viewBox=\"-32 0 512 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M440.667 182.109l7.143-40c1.313-7.355-4.342-14.109-11.813-14.109h-74.81l14.623-81.891C377.123 38.754 371.468 32 363.997 32h-40.632a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891L296.175 128H197.54l14.623-81.891C213.477 38.754 207.822 32 200.35 32h-40.632a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891L132.528 128H53.432a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891l-7.143 40C33.163 185.246 38.818 192 46.289 192h74.81L98.242 320H19.146a12 12 0 0 0-11.813 9.891l-7.143 40C-1.123 377.246 4.532 384 12.003 384h74.81L72.19 465.891C70.877 473.246 76.532 480 84.003 480h40.632a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891L151.826 384h98.634l-14.623 81.891C234.523 473.246 240.178 480 247.65 480h40.632a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891L315.472 384h79.096a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891l7.143-40c1.313-7.355-4.342-14.109-11.813-14.109h-74.81l22.857-128h79.096a12 12 0 0 0 11.813-9.891zM261.889 320h-98.634l22.857-128h98.634l-22.857 128z\"/></svg></a>Maybe So. Maybe Not.</h3>\n<p><em>A farmer and his son had a beloved horse who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbors exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, <strong>what terrible luck</strong>!” The farmer replied, “<strong>Maybe so, maybe not</strong>.”</em></p>\n<p><em>A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild horses back to the farm as well.
