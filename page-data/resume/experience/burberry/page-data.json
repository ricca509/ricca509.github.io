During my contract I led two of our distributed teams of developers, located in Minsk and Shanghai, while working with stakeholders and designers in-house.

Consistency and simplicity were key, to ensure that the cognitive load was kept to a minimum and the code produced would follow our standards regardless of where it was produced.</p>\n<p>As part of my assignment, I also worked closely with the design team to help build the company’s design system: from defining the key strategy and technologies to use to building a set of design tokens to be used across web, email and native apps.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/resume/about-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/resume/experience/f1000/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f5d18ed3-9ccf-5c6b-96c5-b85ee58f68b4","previousPostId":"ef199306-54ef-5998-819c-0d6659a96523","nextPostId":"d52ab82c-b890-5901-8d12-5c42f909df00"}},
