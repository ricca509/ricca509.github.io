My job involved writing JavaScript libraries to be used across the apps, turning PSD designs into semantic HTML5 applications; adding complex interactions handled with the best JavaScript tools and frameworks, always creating modular and maintainable code even with tight schedules.</p>\n<p>I improved the front end workflow by introducing an automated flow for the development: with Grunt.js, we now automate the whole process. From a morning job that takes care of updating the local repository, builds and the deploys the app; to a watcher that lints, checks the coding style with jscs, tests and concatenates + minify and deploy at every file save. I automated the documentation process creating a live styleguide with KSS.</p>\n<p>In our Agile environment we used Jira to handle our sprints’ workflow and Jenkins to build, deploy and test our code.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/resume/experience/burberry/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/resume/experience/klm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d52ab82c-b890-5901-8d12-5c42f909df00","previousPostId":"f5d18ed3-9ccf-5c6b-96c5-b85ee58f68b4","nextPostId":"c3b1c3a9-cda2-5fea-9876-ffa8de232567"}},
